`action-figure-magic` is an _eat your own dog food_ application that utilizes https://github.com/damianmcdonald/rest-magic[rest-magic] to create a fictious web site that uses awesome 80's action figures as the domain.

`action-figure-magic` is implemented with an AngularJS front-end which communicates with mocked web services provided by `rest-magic`.

The application is dynamic and functional. Real calls to external services are made and real server side responses are returned.

You can view the applicaton in action over at //TODO: INSERT_HEROKU_LINK_HERE.
