`action-figure-magic` is a _dog food_ application that utilizes https://github.com/damianmcdonald/rest-magic[RestMagic] to create a fictitious web site that uses awesome 1980's action figures as the domain.

`action-figure-magic` is implemented with an https://angularjs.org/[AngularJS] front-end which communicates with Http web services mocked by RestMagic.

The application is dynamic and functional. Real calls to external services are made and real server side responses are returned.

You can view the applicaton in action over at https://action-figure-magic.herokuapp.com[https://action-figure-magic.herokuapp.com].

You can also take a look at the https://action-figure-magic.herokuapp.com/restmagic/registry/registry.html[RestMagic registry], a listing of all the registered API's being provided by RestMagic.
