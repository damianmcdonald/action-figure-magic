	"description": "M.A.S.K. was a unique toyline pioneered by Kenner in 1985, capitalizing on the rising themes of action features and transformation in the action figure market. Running concurrent to a two-season cartoon by DIC, the series produced four waves of toys before foundering. M.A.S.K. toys centered around ordinary vehicles (scaled to two-inch action figures) which could transform to reveal hidden weaponry, armory, or even change into a different vehicle type. Despite not using die-cast metal, the toys were of a high quality, and detailed with stickers, tampographs, chrome, and rubber tires. Each vehicle included its pilot figure and a science-fiction which could give the figure pretend superpowers. The vehicles typically sported removable weapons, projectiles, and other accessories.",
